# FestiForecast

FestiForecast is a web app used to learn about different areas you may be traveling to by giving you local upcoming events and the weather. We built this app because we realized there was no similar app that could be used to quickly get a run down of whats happening in any given area. From now on with our easy to use site if you are traveling near or far you will be given a quick run down of the weather and what celebratiuons might impact your travel. From building this me and my team learned just how different things can be going for people living close and far from ourselves. 

## Usage

When opened you will see a search bar that you can type in any location you want to know about. After you enter a place press the get info button the forecast and upcoming holidays will be brought up on your screen.
